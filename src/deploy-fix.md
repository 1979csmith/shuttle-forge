# Deployment Fix Strategy

## Current Issue
- Nested project structure causing Vercel confusion
- `C:\Users\chris\shuttle-forge\src\` contains the actual project
- Vercel can't find the right package.json

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Vercel Config (Current)
- Added vercel.json with correct paths
- Points to src/ directory for build

### Option 2: Restructure Project
1. Move all files from src/ to root
2. Remove nested structure
3. Clean deployment

### Option 3: Alternative Platforms
- Netlify (better Vite support)
- GitHub Pages
- Railway
- Render

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Try current Vercel config first
2. If still failing, restructure project
3. Consider Netlify as backup
